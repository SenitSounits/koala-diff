## 📝 What is koala-diff?

koala-diff is a tool that helps you quickly compare large data files. It works with common types like CSV and Parquet files. These files often hold data in tables, like spreadsheets. koala-diff lets you find differences between two files fast, so you can see what changed or what’s missing.

This tool is built to handle big files without slowing down your computer. It uses smart technology under the hood to compare datasets instantly. You do not need to be a programmer to use it. Just follow the steps here.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you use koala-diff, please check that your computer meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Works on Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, and most modern Linux versions.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM. More memory can help with very large files.
- **Processor:** Any modern processor that supports basic instruction sets. koala-diff uses special features to speed up processing, but it will still run on standard CPUs.
- **Disk Space:** At least 50 MB free space for installation.
- **Python:** Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system helps if you want to use it from Python scripts, but there is also a ready-to-use application version.

If you are unsure about these terms, the standard Windows/macOS/Linux on your home or work computer is likely fine.

## 🎯 How to Use koala-diff

Using koala-diff is simple. It does just one main thing: compare two data files.

Follow these steps after opening the program:

1. **Select the first file:** Click the button that asks you to choose the first data file (CSV or Parquet).
2. **Select the second file:** Pick your second file to compare against.
3. **Start comparison:** Click the button to begin the comparison.
4. **View results:** The app will quickly show you what is different. Differences appear as added, removed, or changed entries.

You can scroll through the results in the program window.
